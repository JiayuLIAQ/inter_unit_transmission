The SF6 dosed to level 2 living room by a tube connected to the flow controlling parts. The flow meter in the living room was found to be leaking. The gas flow was stopped but the INNOVA system was continuously monitoring during trouble shooting. After fixing the leakage, the door of the receptor room was opened to reduce the SF6 concentration.
